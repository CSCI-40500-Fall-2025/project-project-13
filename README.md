# Project 13: Hunter ClubHub

## Product Vision

FOR Hunter College students, especially freshmen and new students,

WHO struggle to discover and keep track of campus clubs and events, 

The Hunter ClubHub is a centralized club and event listing website

THAT makes it easy to find, follow, and participate in all club events and campus activities in one place, boosting engagement and awareness.
