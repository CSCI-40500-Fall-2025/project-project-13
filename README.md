# Project 13: ClubHub

## Product Vision

FOR Hunter College students, especially freshmen and new students,

WHO struggle to discover and keep track of campus clubs and events, 

The Hunter ClubHub is a centralized club and event listing website

THAT makes it easy to find, follow, and participate in all club events and campus activities in one place, boosting engagement and awareness.

UNLIKE scattered social media pages, physical posters, or unread emails,

OUR PRODUCT provides a single, up-to-date platform where clubs and students can easily post, find, and manage events, including features for manual posting and automated aggregation from social media.
